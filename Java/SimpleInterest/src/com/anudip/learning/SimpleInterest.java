// Assignment - 1
//Write a program to enter P,T (principal and time) and calculate
//simple interest. Use the Scanner class for taking inputs from the
//console. Users will enter the principal amount and time(in years).
//Create an if-else statement and modify the interest rate based on the
//principal amount. If the amount > 10000 then the interest rate is 10%. 
//If the amount is between 10000 and 5000 then make the interest rate 8%.
//For any amount below 5000 the interest rate should be 5%.
